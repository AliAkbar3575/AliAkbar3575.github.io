                I am serving as a <b>Research Assistant</b> at the <b>Data & Design Lab</b>. I am currently working on a 
                Govt-funded project aimed at enhancing the quality of power supply to industrial clusters 
                across Dhaka City through statistical analysis, including unsupervised machine learning-based 
                clustering techniques. We collected real-time, on-field data from various electricity 
                distribution companies (such as DESCO and PGCB), as well as from multiple substations and 
                industries under the Rural Electrification Board (REB), in order to assess the power quality 
                status in Bangladesh. As part of this project, an interactive chatbot is being developed for 
                consumers, enabling them to inquire about electricity issues. Additionally, another team is 
                preparing a dashboard to visualize the overall behavior of electricity across the country.

                Although this research is not directly related to my core research field, it has provided 
                me with valuable experience in <b>field-level data collection</b>, <b>manuscript writing</b>, and <b>working 
                collaboratively within a team under experienced supervisors</b>. Moreover, it allowed me to engage with and 
                learn from other researchers across different universities in our country which has enhanced 
                my research perspective and professional network.

    <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">My research interests lie in the field of 
        <b>Machine Learning</b>, <b>Computer vision</b>, <b>Medical Imaging</b> 
        and <b>Multimodal ML</b>. I come from a developing country where the integration of advanced 
        technologies in the medical sector remains limited. In addition, a large portion of population 
        depends on agriculture that has minimal technological integration on farming. Therefore, this 
        reality strongly motivated me to gain expertise in deep learning, computer vision in order to 
        develop practical and impactful technological solutions for agriculture and healthcare. I am
        deeply interested in working in these research areas.</p>

<!-- ===== PROJECTS ===== -->
<section id="projects">
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div class="project">
        <h3>Nurse Care Activity Recognition from Accelerometer Sensor Data Using Fourier- and
Wavelet-based Features.</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">A series of pre-processing steps were performed, including data cleaning,
resampling, windowing, and filtering. Feature extraction was conducted using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Subsequently, feature selection techniques such as Variance
Threshold, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests were employed. Finally, a range of machine learning algorithms was
employed to classify 25 distinct nurse activities. <i>(May, 2021)</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>COVID and Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) disease diagnosis based on chest CT scan
images using Deep Neural Network.</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">The dataset used in this study was sourced from an open-access
online platform. The images were converted into numerical data, followed by resizing and rescaling to prepare
them for effective analysis and model training. Various pre-trained deep learning models were applied, with a
custom 4-layer fully connected network with dropout added below the pre-trained layers (modified architecture),
and their performance was comprehensively compared. Model selection was performed based on various
performance metrics, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. <i>(B.Sc.Thesis 4th Year, 2nd Semester)</i></p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>End-to-End micro-bacterial segmentation and detection using ViT-based model.</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">Publicly accessible open-source bacteria image dataset (M-ROSE dataset) 
            was utilized in this study. We have proposed a Max-ViT backbone based Mask R-CNN (instance segmentation) model
            and compared the results with the CNN-based backbone Mask R-CNN models (ResNet50, EfficientNet) for the both segmentation 
            and detection. We have demonstrated that our Max-ViT based vision transformer architecture outperformed the existing CNN-based models.

    <div class="project">
        <h3>A Visual Question Answering Framework for Plant Leaf Disease Using SOTA Vision–Language
Models.</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">We collected approximately 600k plant leaf disease images from open-source datasets and, after
preprocessing, reduced the dataset to around 300k images. Our objective is to develop a chatbot-like framework
for leaf disease analysis, where different questions can be asked based on leaf disease images. To achieve this,
our goal is to generate nearly 1M question–answer (QA) pairs from these images and validate them with the
assistance of senior biologists. Subsequently, we will apply state-of-the-art vision–language models (VLMs) and
compare their performance using various metrics.</p>

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Integrating Gut Microbiome Taxonomic Profiles with Supervised Machine Learning for IBS
(Irritable Bowel Syndrome) Diagnosis.</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;">We collected 1,093 publicly available DNA sequencing datasets of
IBS patients and healthy controls from NCBI, and added 10 IBS and 6 healthy samples sequenced from
individuals in Bangladesh. All raw sequences were processed through the CZID pipeline to remove human DNA
and ensure data quality. After collecting the dataset, several preprocessing steps were carried out.
Hyperparameters were optimized using Optuna, which is based on the Bayesian optimization method and 5-fold
cross-validation was performed to evaluate the generalization of the models. Subsequently, the dataset was
split, and several machine learning models were trained. The models were then evaluated using various metrics,
including Accuracy, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and AUROC.</p>
