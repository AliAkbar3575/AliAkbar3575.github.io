            <h3>Research Assistant</h3>
            <h4>Data & Design Lab</h4> 
            <p>Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Dhaka</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;">I am serving as a <b>Research Assistant</b> at the <b>Data & Design</b> Lab. My research focus in this lab is improving the quality of power supply to the industrial clusters around Dhaka city by using a variety of statistical parameters and forecasting future demands based different machine learning algorithms. We collected real-time data from different power transmission as well as distribution companies to identify power quality status of Bangladesh.</p>

        <img src="assets/images/cv.png" alt="Description 3" width="200" height="200">
        
    <p style="text-align: justify;">My research interests lie in the field of <b>Machine Learning</b>, <b>Deep Learning</b>, <b>Computer vision</b>, <b>Medical Imaging</b> and <b>Multimodal ML</b>. I come from a developing country where the integration of advanced technologies in the medical sector remains limited. In addition, a large portion of population depends on agriculture that has minimal technological integration on farming. Therefore, this reality strongly motivated me to gain expertise in deep learning, computer vision in order to develop practical and impactful technological solutions for agriculture and healthcare. I am deeply interested in working in these research areas.</p>

<!-- ===== PROJECTS ===== -->
<section id="projects">
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div class="project">
        <h3>Nurse Care Activity Recognition from Accelerometer Sensor Data Using Fourier- and
Wavelet-based Features</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">A series of pre-processing steps were performed, including data cleaning,
resampling, windowing, and filtering. Feature extraction was conducted using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Subsequently, feature selection techniques such as Variance
Threshold, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests were employed. Finally, a range of machine learning algorithms was
employed to classify 25 distinct nurse activities. (May, 2021)</p>
